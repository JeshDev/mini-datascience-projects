## Description

### 1. Classify Song Genres from Audio Data

Using a dataset comprised of songs of two music genres (Hip-Hop and Rock), a classifier is trained to distinguish between the two genres based only on track information derived from Echonest(now part of Spotify). Pandas and seaborn packages in Python were used for subsetting the data, aggregating information, and exploring the data for obvious trends. The scikit-learn package is used to predict whether we can correctly classify a song's genre based on features such as danceability, energy, acousticness, tempo, etc. The implementations of common algorithms such as PCA, logistic regression, decision trees are explored.

### 2. Find Movie Similarity from Plot Summaries

In this Project, NLP techniques are used to find the degree of similarity between movies based on their plots available on IMDb and Wikipedia. The dataset contains the titles of the top 100 movies on IMDb as well as each movie's plot summary from both IMDb and Wikipedia.

### 3. Predicting Credit Card Approvals

Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). In this project, an automatic credit card approval predictor is built using machine learning techniques similar to  how every commercial bank does so nowadays. The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
